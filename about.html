        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
        <p>We believe the true basis of Christian fellowship is God’s love, which unites us despite our differences. Without His love, we cannot truly call ourselves Christians. As a family of faith, we encourage, strengthen, and help each other, working together to do the things Jesus has called us to do. We would love to have you join us in our mission to glorify God and share His love with our community.</p>

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>When you arrive, our guest greeters will welcome you warmly. We are a “come as you are” congregation—no dress code, just people united in the love of God. Our services reflect the acts of worship outlined in the New Testament:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Singing:</strong> We lift our voices in praise without instrumental accompaniment, following New Testament teachings. (Eph 5:19, Col 3:16)</li>
          <li><strong>Giving:</strong> Members are encouraged to give as God has blessed them. Visitors are welcome to participate but are not obligated. (1 Cor 16:1-2)</li>
          <li><strong>Praying:</strong> We communicate with God through prayers of thanksgiving, praise, and requests for help. (Acts 2:42)</li>
          <li><strong>Preaching:</strong> A gospel sermon is delivered to deepen understanding and encourage daily living in Christ. (Acts 20:7)</li>
          <li><strong>Communion:</strong> Members partake weekly to remember Christ’s sacrifice. It includes unleavened bread (His body) and fruit of the vine (His blood). (1 Cor 11:23-29)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also offer an invitation for prayer requests, membership, or baptism. We hope you’ll visit and feel at home with us!</p>
